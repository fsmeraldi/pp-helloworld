    "\"I believe that Python is important for software development. While there are more powerful languages (e.g. Lisp), faster languages (e.g. C), more used languages (e.g. Java), and weirder languages (e.g. Haskell), Python gets a lot of different things right, and right in a combination that no other language I know of has done so far\" (Fredrik Blaag).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Python makes writing good code easy;\n",
    "* Python syntax is clean and easy to read;\n",
    "* It allows you to start simple - what you don't know (mostly) won't harm;\n",
    "* In spite of that, it supports very advanced programming techniques and styles;\n",
    "* It offers excellent interactive tools (like these notebooks) that make learning easy;\n",
    "* There are plenty of online resources to support you;\n",
    "* It is a real-world, general purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth emphasizing this last point: there are plenty of Python programming jobs out there that range from web development to full-stack engineering (a [chimeric professional figure](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/17/imho-the-mythical-fullstack-engineer/)  much loved by recruiters) to much more trendy and esoteric stuff.
