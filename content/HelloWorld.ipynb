While there are more powerful languages (e.g. Lisp), faster languages (e.g. C), more used languages (e.g. Java), and weirder languages (e.g. Haskell), Python gets a lot of different things right, and right in a combination that no other language I know of has done so far\" (Fredrik Blaag).\n",

    "* It allows you to start simple - what you don't know (mostly) won't harm;\n",
    "* In spite of that, it supports very advanced programming techniques and styles;\n",
    "* It offers excellent interactive tools (like these notebooks) that make learning easy;\n",
    "* There are plenty of online resources to support you;\n",
